          <p>Canada üá®üá¶ is rising folks. Will you be a part of her future radiance? I hope ü§ûüèª so because now‚Äôs the time. The groundswell of kindness and reason has made a way for you to join in. To welcome truths over fear. To come out of hiding & reluctant obedience. To honour the patriots of diligent searching. Of earnest & hard working neighbours & citizens. The willingly broken and educated masses. People of all ages & stages are rising. Asleep no more. Reformation literally means ‚Äúre-formation‚Äù. Things re-forged. Re-made through üî•. #barbwall #leadersgetup</p>

          <p>Stay tuned for my new book coming soon!!!</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‚Äòaiming for the stars.‚Äô Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>" My soul (mind, will & emotions) waits only on God; for my expectation is from Him.‚Äù Ps 62:5 
            <br/>
            I remember learning the language of waiting as Curt & I dated through College. I also remember learning it through early marriage long before any of our kids came along. Learning it continually since then is equal to Jesus great test in the wilderness. Who did He trust for food? In the desert? While starving? With powers? Ishmael was created when Abraham & Sarah decided not to wait. To use their power. Surely God meant them to take matters into their own hands? Surely that. Waiting on God is an incredibly interactive process. You don‚Äôt just commit to doing it in a millisecond only to impulsively violate it‚Äôs terms seconds later. It involves a tearing down of self-power with the uncomfortability of trust. It hurts until it doesn‚Äôt. Patience is like asparagus which takes many yrs. till first harvest. You won‚Äôt see the good things you‚Äôve waited on God for in that millisecond. True peace is long fought for. But then, when you are going along one day, your history with God will reveal itself. His faithfulness will have proved to outshine every blight year. Every hailed crop. Every drought. You‚Äôll see wild roses, & choice ever bearing fruit crops. Your table will be graced with wine üç∑ whose orchard you wept over through painstaking maintenance. ‚ÄúEven though‚Äù. ‚ÄúDespite‚Äù & completely ‚ÄúIn wake of‚Äù. Things multiplied. Flourished. Overwhelmed you with bounty. We are the opposite of perfect. We are passionate. Unique. Principled. Warriors for the Garden of good. God can be trusted. Give Him the chance to prove tho circumstances weigh heavy, be disastrous, & even include highway robbery. The weights & justice of God reward those with expectations planted in the heart of His abundance. It‚Äôs not fair. None of it is. The harvest is simply bigger than the small amount of blood, sweat & trust I learned to possess in the wait. I‚Äôve received far more than I ever contributed. And, despite every outcry, no agenda, king, plot or devious evil has overruled the unparalleled force of my hugely surrendered heart. There‚Äôs simply been no contest in the attempt

          <p>There is always more to explore, learn and discover</p>

          <p>Exploration at its greatest, is our spirit's desire to connect with eternity and the reason for which we were born.</p>
